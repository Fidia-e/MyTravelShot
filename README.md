## What is My Travel Shot?

My Travel Shot is an application that I imagined for photo lovers, and more precisely, for vacation photos. From landscapes, sunsets or more personal photos, each author can post his favorite photos and share them with the public.
The application can be defined as a social network because after validating his registration, the user becomes an author and joins the community of photographers of the site. He chooses his author pseudo with which he will sign his publications that he can immediately start posting. He chooses a title, an associated image and a description and will see his publication displayed with this information, as well as his artist name (pseudo).
If he is in need of inspiration, he will be able to access, via an album, the list of the other authors of the site, and will be able to be inspired by their respective photos.
The home page of the site, exposes all the photos published in the whole application, in a totally random way each time he arrives on the page.

__Nevertheless, My Travel Shot is an application that I thought and realized, only with the aim of covering the typical back-end activities for the passage of the professional title Web and Mobile Web Developer.
Therefore, I have only developed the back-office of the application.__  
_I had a deadline of two weeks_

## How does My Travel Shot work?

__Users and Roles:__
Three roles are possible: _Author, Admin and Super-admin_
You must be registered to the site to be assigned the Author role. An author can see the list of users and their role, their associated author nickname and their respective photos. But he can only manage his profile and his personal photos: create, modify and delete them.
An admin has the same rights as the author, but in addition he can manage all the authors by creating, modifying and deleting them.
The super-admin can manage absolutely everything on the site. Including adding a new user, modifying or deleting it.
